# Project & Portfolio 1: Development #

This portfolio is for my Portfolio Course at Full Sail.

### Purpose ###

My goal here is to showcase my work and improve/refactor projects from my previous Scaleable Data Infrastructures course.

### Getting Started ###

At the current moment, all programs here are C# console executables designed to be run through Command Prompt.

### Contributing ###

Currently, I am not accepting pull requests on this project as it is a personal build, however I am open to comments on [LukeCreative/billingtonluke_portfolio/](https://bitbucket.org/LukeCreative/billingtonluke_portfolio/).

### Burn List ###
My current burn list can be found on my [Trello](https://trello.com/b/7fQHyYee/billingtonluke-portfoilio).
